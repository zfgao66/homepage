In this paper, we predict that LiFe2F6 is a d-wave altermagnetic and charge-ordering-mediated ferroelectric material. Moreover, the LiFe2F6 transforms into a ferrimagnetic and ferroelectric phase with strong magnetoelectric coupling under biaxial compressive strain. Interestingly, the spins of the valence band and the conduction band are opposite in ferrimagnetic LiFe2F6, which facilitates a simultaneous spin-triplet excitonic insulator phase.

In this paper, we propose a new dataset compression method that compresses datasets by filtering long-range correlation information in task-agnostic scenarios and uses dataset distillation to supplement the information in task-specific scenarios.  Experiments obtained better model performance (3.19% on average) than state-of-the-art methods for the same compression rate.

In this paper, we demonstrate that strong spin-orbit coupling effect can be realized in light element altermagnetic materials, and propose a mechanism for realizing the corresponding effective spin-orbit coupling. This mechanism reveals the cooperative effect of crystal symmetry, electron occupation, electronegativity, electron correlation, and intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Our work not only promotes the understanding of light element compounds with strong spin-orbit coupling effect, but also provides an alternative for realizing light element compounds with an effective strong spin-orbit coupling.

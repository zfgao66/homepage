In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that CrB4 is an ideal type-II Dirac nodal chain semimetal protected by the mirror symmetry. Moreover, there are two nodal rings protected by both space-inversion and time-reversal symmetries in CrB4. More importantly,in CrB4 the topologically protected drumhead surface states span the entire Brillouin zone at the Fermi level.

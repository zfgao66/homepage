In this paper, we predict four ideal two-dimensional type-I altermagnetic bipolarized Weyl semimetals Fe2WTe4 and Fe2MoZ4 (Z=S,Se,Te). More significantly, we introduce the quantum crystal valley Hall effect, a phenomenon achievable in three of these materials namely Fe2WTe4, Fe2MoS4, and Fe2MoTe4, when spin-orbit coupling is considered. Furthermore, these materials have the potential to transition from a quantum crystal valley Hall phase to a Chern insulator phase under strain.

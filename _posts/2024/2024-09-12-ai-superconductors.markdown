In this paper, we develop an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for discovery of high-Tc superconductors. Utilizing this AI search engine, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be Tcâ‰¥ 15 K based on a very small set of samples.

The time-reversal symmetry is thought to be a necessary condition for realizing valley Hall effect. If the time-reversal symmetry is broken, whether the valley Hall effect can be realized has not been explored. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that the vally Hall effect without time-reversal symmetry can be realized in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials Fe2WSe4 and Fe2WS4. Due to crystal symmetry required, the vally Hall effect without time-reversal symmetry is called crystal vally Hall effect. In addition, under uniaxial strain, both monolayer Fe2WSe4 and Fe2WS4 can realize piezomagnetic effect. Under biaxial compressive stress, both monolayer Fe2WSe4 and Fe2WS4 will transform from altermagnetic semiconductor phase to bipolarized topological Weyl semimetal phase. Our work not only provides a new direction for exploring the novel valley Hall effect, but also provides a good platform for exploring altermagnetic semiconductors and altermagnetic topological phase transitions.

In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that LaMn2SbO6 is a unconventional compensated magnetic semiconductor. Given that the Mn ions at opposite spin lattice cannot be connected by any symmetry, the spin splitting in LaMn2SbO6 is isotropic. More importantly, LaMn2SbO6 has already been synthesized experimentally, and its magnetic structure has been confirmed by neutron scattering experiments.

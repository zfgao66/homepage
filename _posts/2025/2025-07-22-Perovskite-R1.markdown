In this work, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning.

In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we propose for the first time that anomalous charge density wave can be realized in two-dimensional altermagnetic WO. The anomalous charge density wave is characterized by three key features: (i) Unlike conventional charge density wave, whose stabilization is driven by the opening of a gap near the Fermi level, the anomalous charge density wave is stabilized by the occupied states with energies shifting lower far away from the Fermi level; (ii) the anomalous charge density wave increases the density of states near the Fermi level and then enhances-rather than diminishes-the metallicity of materials
